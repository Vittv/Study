Basically taught a bunch about the Chrome Devtools through the official documentation

A few of the points were:

    - View and change CSS through Devtools
    - View and change HTML through Devtools
    - Simulate mobile devices with Device mode
    - Debugging JavaScript
    - Pausing code with breakpoints
