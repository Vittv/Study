Basically taught a bunch about the Chrome Devtools through the official documentation

A few of the points were:

    - View and change CSS through Devtools
    - View and change HTML through Devtools
    - Simulate mobile devices with Device mode
    - Debugging JavaScript
    - Pausing code with breakpoints

It taught how to debug code through the Devtools console, without having to console.log() everything
