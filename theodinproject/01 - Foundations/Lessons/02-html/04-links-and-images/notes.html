    <h2>Opening links in a new tab</h2>

    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>

    <!-- Always try to add noopener and noreferrer
     
    The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.

    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.
    
    Why do we need this added behaviour for opening links in new tabs? Security reasons. The prevention of access that is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as tabnabbing. Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.

    Note that you may be fine if you forget to add rel="noopener noreferrer" since more recent versions of browsers provide security if only target="_blank" is present. Nevertheless, in line with good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer".

    <h2>Absolute and relative links</h2>

    <h3>Absolute links</h3>

    <p>Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: <code>protocol://domain/path</code>. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.
    
    <p>We’ve already seen an absolute link in action. The link we created to The Odin Project’s About page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the protocol and domain.</p>
    
    <code>https://www.theodinproject.com/about</code>
    
    <h3>Relative links</h3>

    <p>Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.</p>
    
    <p>Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on.</p>

    A metaphor

    Absolute and relative links are a tricky concept to build a good mental model of, a metaphor may help:

    Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html.

    <h2>Alt attribute</h2>

    <p>The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.</p>

    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="charles dog">

    <h2>Image size attributes</h2>

    <p>While not strictly required, specifying height and width attributes in image tags helps the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.</p>

    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="charles dog" height="310" width="310">
