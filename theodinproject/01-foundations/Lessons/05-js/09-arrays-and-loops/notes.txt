Arrays are variables that can hold more than one value. They are considered objects, but function diferently than objects.

Indexing

    An object will require a name to access a member of its group. While an array will require an index number.

    Array Example:

    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    cars[0] // would be Saab

    (In most programming languages, counting starts from 0 when it comes to arrays)

    Object example:

    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};
    person.firstName // would be John

Array Elements Can be objects

    JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

    Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

    You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

    myArray[0] = Date.now;
    myArray[1] = myFunction;
    myArray[2] = myCars;

Array Properties and Methods

    The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:

    cars.length   // Returns the number of elements
    cars.sort()   // Sorts the array

    The length Property

        The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        let length = fruits.length; 

        (The length property is always one more than the highest array index.)

    Accessing the First Array Element

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        let fruit = fruits[0];

    Accessing the Last Array Element

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1];

    Looping Array Elements

        One way to loop through an array, is using a for loop:

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        let fLen = fruits.length;

        let text = "<ul>";
        for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
        text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
        }
        text += "</ul>";  

        You can also use the Array.forEach() function:

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

        let text = "<ul>";
        fruits.forEach(myFunction);
        text += "</ul>";

        function myFunction(value) {
        text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
        }

    Adding Array Elements

        The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method:

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
        fruits.push("Lemon");  // Adds a new element (Lemon) to fruits

        New element can also be added to an array using the length property:

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
        fruits[fruits.length] = "Lemon";  // Adds "Lemon" to fruits

        WARNING !

        Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array:

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
        fruits[6] = "Lemon";  // Creates undefined "holes" in fruits

    Associative Arrays

        Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

        Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

        JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

        In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.

        const person = [];
        person[0] = "John";
        person[1] = "Doe";
        person[2] = 46;
        person.length;    // Will return 3
        person[0];        // Will return "John"

        WARNING !!

        If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object.

        After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.

        const person = [];
        person["firstName"] = "John";
        person["lastName"] = "Doe";
        person["age"] = 46;
        person.length;     // Will return 0
        person[0];         // Will return undefined

    The Difference Between Arrays and objects

        In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.

        In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

        Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

    When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.

       - JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
       - You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
       - You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.

    JavaScript new Array()

        JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().

        But you can safely use [] instead.

        These two different statements both create a new empty array named points:

            const points = new Array();
            const points = [];

        These two different statements both create a new array containing 6 numbers:

            const points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10);
            const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 

        The new keyword can produce some unexpected results:

            // Create an array with three elements:
            const points = new Array(40, 100, 1);
            
            // Create an array with two elements:
            const points = new Array(40, 100); 

            // Create an array with one element ???
            const points = new Array(40);

    A Common Error

        const points = [40];

        is not the same as:

        const points = new Array(40);

        // Create an array with one element:
        const points = [40];

        // Create an array with 40 undefined elements:
        const points = new Array(40);   

    How to Recognize an Array            

        A common question is: How do I know if a variable is an array?

        The problem is that the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object":

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
        let type = typeof fruits;

        The typeof operator returns object because a JavaScript array is an object.


        Solution 1:

        To solve this problem ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 2009) defined a new method Array.isArray():

        Array,isArray(fruits);


        Solution 2:

        The instanceof operator returns true if an object is created by a given constructor:

        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];

        (fruits instanceof Array);

    Nested Arrays and Objects

        Values in objects can be arrays, and values in arrays can be objects:

        const myObj = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        cars: [
            {name:"Ford", models:["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"]},
            {name:"BMW", models:["320", "X3", "X5"]},
            {name:"Fiat", models:["500", "Panda"]}
        ]
        }

        To access arrays inside arrays, use a for-in loop for each array:

        for (let i in myObj.cars) {
        x += "<h1>" + myObj.cars[i].name + "</h1>";
        for (let j in myObj.cars[i].models) {
            x += myObj.cars[i].models[j];
        }
        }

JavaScript Array Methods

    Array length        Array shift()       Array flatMap()
    Array toString()    Array unshift()     Array slice()
    Array at()          Array delete()      Array splice()
    Array join()        Array concat()      Array toSpliced()
    Array pop()         Array copyWithin()  
    Array push()        Array flat()

    TLDR:

        length = returns the length (size) of an array
        can also be used to append a new element to an array

        toString() = converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array
        values

        at() = returns an indexed element from an array, same as []

        join() = joins all array elements into a string, just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator (won't be commas necessarily like toString())

        pop() = removes the last element from an array (from the end)
        returns "popped out"

        push() = adds a new element to an array (at the end)
        returns the new array length

        shift() = removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index
        returns "shifted out"

        unshift() = adds a new element to an array(at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements
        returns the new array length

        delete() = using delete() leaves undefined holes in the array
        use pop() or shift() instead

        concat() = creates a new array by merging (concatenating) existing arrays
        The concat() method does not change the existing arrays. It always returns a new array
        The concat() method can take any number of array arguments

        copyWithin() = copies array elements to another position in an array
        The copyWithin() method overwrites the existing values.
        The copyWithin() method does not add items to the array.
        The copyWithin() method does not change the length of the array

        flat() = creates a new array with sub-array elements concatenated to a specified depth

        flatMap() = maps all elements of an array and then creates a new array by flattening the array

        splice() = adds new items to an array
        can be used to add new items to an array
        The splice() method returns an array with the deleted items

        toSpliced() = added as a safe way to splice an array without altering the original array
        The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array

        slice() = slices out a piece of an array into a new array
        The slice() method creates a new array
        The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array
        The slice() method can take two arguments

Loops

    Looping

        Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.

    Why are loops useful?

        Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.

        Example:

        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            ctx.beginPath();
            ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
            ctx.arc(
                random(canvas.width),
                random(canvas.height),
                random(50),
                0,
                2 * Math.PI,
            );
            ctx.fill();
        }

        If we didn't loop this, we'd have to repeat the same code for x amount of times we wanted it executed. But with a loop, all we have to do is change a single digit at the start of the code.

    Looping through a collection

        Most of the time when you use a loop, you will have a collection of items and want to do something with every item.

        The for...of loop

            The basic tool for looping through a collection is the for...of loop:

            const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

            for (const cat of cats) {
                console.log(cat);
            }

            In this example, for (const cat of cats) says:

            1. Given the collection cats, get the first item in the collection.

            2. Assign it to the variable cat and then run the code between the curly braces {}.

            3. Get the next item, and repeat (2) until you've reached the end of the collection.

        map() and filter()

            JavaScript also has more specialized loops for collections, and we'll mention two of them here.

            You can use map() to do something to each item in a collection and create a new collection containing the changed items:

            function toUpper(string) {
            return string.toUpperCase();
            }

            const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

            const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper);

            console.log(upperCats);
            // [ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]

            Here we pass a function into cats.map(), and map() calls the function once for each item in the array, passing in the item. It then adds the return value from each function call to a new array, and finally returns the new array. In this case the function we provide converts the item to uppercase, so the resulting array contains all our cats in uppercase:

            [ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]

            You can use filter() to test each item in a collection, and create a new collection containing only items that match:

            function lCat(cat) {
            return cat.startsWith("L");
            }

            const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

            const filtered = cats.filter(lCat);

            console.log(filtered);
            // [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]

            This looks a lot like map(), except the function we pass in returns a boolean: if it returns true, then the item is included in the new array. Our function tests that the item starts with the letter "L", so the result is an array containing only cats whose names start with "L":

            [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]

            Note that map() and filter() are both often used with function expressions, which we will learn about in the Functions module. Using function expressions we could rewrite the example above to be much more compact:

            const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

            const filtered = cats.filter((cat) => cat.startsWith("L"));
            console.log(filtered);
            // [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]


    The standard for loop

        In the "drawing circles" example above, you don't have a collection of items to loop through: you really just want to run the same code 100 times. In a case like that, you should use the for loop. This has the following syntax:

        for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
        // code to run
        }

        Here we have:

            1. The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.

            2. Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semicolons:

                i. An initializer — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a counter variable.

                ii. A condition — this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.

                iii. A final-expression — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the point where the condition is no longer true.

            3. Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.
 

    Looping through collections with a for loop

        You can use a for loop to iterate through a collection, instead of a for...of loop.

        const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

        for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
        console.log(cats[i]);
        }

        In this loop we're starting i at 0, and stopping when i reaches the length of the array. Then inside the loop, we're using i to access each item in the array in turn.

        This works just fine, and in early versions of JavaScript, for...of didn't exist, so this was the standard way to iterate through an array. However, it offers more chances to introduce bugs into your code. For example:

           - you might start i at 1, forgetting that the first array index is zero, not 1.

           - you might stop at i <= cats.length, forgetting that the last array index is at length - 1.

        For reasons like this, it's usually best to use for...of if you can.


    Exiting loops with a break

        If you want to exit a loop before all the iterations have been completed, you can use the break statement.

        A break statement will immediately exit the loop and make the browser move on to any code that follows it.

        Say we wanted to search through an array of contacts and telephone numbers and return just the number we wanted to find? First, some simple HTML — a text <input> allowing us to enter a name to search for, a <button> element to submit a search, and a <p> element to display the results in:

        const contacts = [
        "Chris:2232322",
        "Sarah:3453456",
        "Bill:7654322",
        "Mary:9998769",
        "Dianne:9384975",
        ];
        const para = document.querySelector("p");
        const input = document.querySelector("input");
        const btn = document.querySelector("button");

        btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
        const searchName = input.value.toLowerCase();
        input.value = "";
        input.focus();
        para.textContent = "";
        for (const contact of contacts) {
            const splitContact = contact.split(":");
            if (splitContact[0].toLowerCase() === searchName) {
            para.textContent = `${splitContact[0]}'s number is ${splitContact[1]}.`;
            break;
            }
        }
        if (para.textContent === "") {
            para.textContent = "Contact not found.";
        }
        });

    Skipping iterations with continue

        The continue statement works similarly to break, but instead of breaking out of the loop entirely, it skips to the next iteration of the loop. Let's look at another example that takes a number as an input, and returns only the numbers that are squares of integers (whole numbers).

        const para = document.querySelector("p");
        const input = document.querySelector("input");
        const btn = document.querySelector("button");

        btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
        para.textContent = "Output: ";
        const num = input.value;
        input.value = "";
        input.focus();
        for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            let sqRoot = Math.sqrt(i);
            if (Math.floor(sqRoot) !== sqRoot) {
            continue;
            }
            para.textContent += `${i} `;
        }
        });


    while and do...while

        initializer
        while (condition) {
            // code to run

            final-expression
        }

        This works in a very similar way to the for loop, except that the initializer variable is set before the loop, and the final-expression is included inside the loop after the code to run, rather than these two items being included inside the parentheses. The condition is included inside the parentheses, which are preceded by the while keyword rather than for.

        The same three items are still present, and they are still defined in the same order as they are in the for loop. This is because you must have an initializer defined before you can check whether or not the condition is true. The final-expression is then run after the code inside the loop has run (an iteration has been completed), which will only happen if the condition is still true.

        const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

        let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

        let i = 0;

        while (i < cats.length) {
        if (i === cats.length - 1) {
            myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
        } else {
            myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
        }

        i++;
        }

        console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."


        The do...while loop is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure:

        initializer
        do {
        // code to run

        final-expression
        } while (condition)

        The main difference between a do...while loop and a while loop is that the code inside a do...while loop is always executed at least once. That's because the condition comes after the code inside the loop. So we always run that code, then check to see if we need to run it again. In while and for loops, the check comes first, so the code might never be executed.

        const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

        let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

        let i = 0;

        do {
        if (i === cats.length - 1) {
            myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
        } else {
            myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
        }

        i++;
        } while (i < cats.length);

        console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."
