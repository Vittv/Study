HTML Tables allow you to create two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns.

HTML tables

    Some data just really needs to be displayed in a table. HTML tables might be less commonly used than buttons, links, lists and everything else you’ve learned so far, but there are some cases where they’re the perfect tool. Some of the more advanced features can get a little tricky to set up correctly but getting started with tables is pretty easy. You create a table with <table></table> tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers, or anything else that’s possible inside those table elements.

General table structure

    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>First Header</th>
        <th>Second Header</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This is a data cell</td>
        <td>This is also a data cell!</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
