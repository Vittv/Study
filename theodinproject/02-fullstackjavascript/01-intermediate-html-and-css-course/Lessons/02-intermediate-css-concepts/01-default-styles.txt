What are default styles and where do they come from?

    As you have worked on projects, you likely observed default styles applied to certain elements, such as larger and bolder headings on h1 elements, and blue, underlined links on a elements. There is also a good chance you struggled with things like default margins and padding. These styles are part of the user-agent stylesheets, ensuring basic styling for webpages without CSS. Each browser has its own set of user-agent stylesheets so the default styles do vary slightly between browsers.

What if I don't like the defaults?

    With very few exceptions you can simply write your own CSS rules. The rules you write in your stylesheet have higher precedence than the user-agents rules, and therefore overwrite the defaults. However, there is another option.

    To address inconsistencies across browsers and establish a consistent starting point for styling, some developers started using CSS resets. These resets are stylesheets containing CSS rules aimed at altering or removing the defaults set by user-agent stylesheets. Using them can help achieve consistency, and can provide a clean slate for developers to apply their styles without interference.

    While CSS resets are still commonly used, they are not mandatory. Some developers opt not to use them, while others create their own or utilize prebuilt resets. Itâ€™s important to understand that resets are subjective and opinionated, reflecting the preferences of the developer who created them. You can decide how you wish to do things yourself.
