Rendering a list of elements in JSX

  Let us say we want to create a component that lists multiple animals:

    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Animals: </h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Lion</li>
            <li>Cow</li>
            <li>Snake</li>
            <li>Lizard</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      );
    }

  It is perfectly acceptable, but what if we want to render more than just four? It can be tedious and long, and most of the time, we will be dealing with a data structure (like a list) rather than hard-coding each animal. You have previously learned that we can embed expressions inside JSX with curly braces. So let us do just that:

    function App() {
      const animals = ["Lion", "Cow", "Snake", "Lizard"];

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Animals: </h1>
          <ul>
            {animals.map((animal) => {
              return <li key={animal}>{animal}</li>;
            })}
          </ul>
        </div>
      );
    }

  We define an array called animals. Now inside our JSX, we use map to return a new array of li elements, adding animal as its text. It should now render the same as the previous snippet we wrote. This is because JSX has the ability to automatically render arrays. The following code is identical:

    function App() {
      const animals = ["Lion", "Cow", "Snake", "Lizard"];
      const animalsList = animals.map((animal) => <li key={animal}>{animal}</li>)

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Animals: </h1>
          <ul>
            {animalsList}
          </ul>
        </div>
      );
    }

  You may be curious as to what the key is in our <li> element. We will dive into how keys work in the next lesson. But, to explain briefly, it is to let React know the identity of each element in the list. React must know this information if you are dealing with a dynamic list where you add or remove elements. Since we are only dealing with a static list, it does not matter for now.

Rendering a list of components in JSX

  # Passing data into components

    We will use props here, and you will learn more about them in a future lesson. For now, you just need to know that props are just like function arguments that are passed into components, but to pass them we use a syntax similar to how we pass attributes to HTML elements. As you can see in the following short implementation.

      function ListItem(props) {
        return <li>{props.animal}</li>
      }

      function List(props) {
        return (
          <ul>
            {props.animals.map((animal) => {
              return <ListItem key={animal} animal={animal} />;
            })}
          </ul>
        );
      }

      function App() {
        const animals = ["Lion", "Cow", "Snake", "Lizard"];

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Animals: </h1>
            <List animals={animals} />
          </div>
        );
      }

    We have moved our <ul> element to a different component called <List />. It still returns the <ul> element, but we can do a lot more with it as a component.

    This component accepts a props which is an object containing the animals that we defined as a property when we wrote <List animals={animals} />. Do note that you can name it anything, for example, <List animalList={animals} />. You will still need to pass the animals to the property, but now you will use props.animalList instead of props.animals.

    We have also created a different component for the <li> element called <ListItem />, which also accepts props, and uses props.animal to render the text. It should now render the same thing.

    # "Missing in props validation"

      You may notice squiggly lines under your props, for example, under animal inside the <ListItem /> component avove.

      Hovering over these will tell you they are missing in props validation. For now, this can safely be ignored as it is just a default ESLint rule warning about prop types, something that will be covered later in the course.

      You may want to turn off this rule by adding the following to your eslint.config.js file:

        rules: {
          // Your other rules
          "react/prop-types": "off"
        }

Conditionally rendering UI

  Let us make some decisions within our component. What if we only want to render an animal that starts with the letter L? To make these decisions, we would use some sort of conditional expression. Let us continue using the code above, but for brevity’s sake, we will be removing the <ListItem /> component.

  Using the ternary operator

    One way to conditionally render an element is with a ternary operator, using a boolean value to decide what to render:

      function List(props) {
        return (
          <ul>
            {props.animals.map((animal) => {
              return animal.startsWith("L") ? <li key={animal}>{animal}</li> : null;
            })}
          </ul>
        );
      }

      function App() {
        const animals = ["Lion", "Cow", "Snake", "Lizard"];

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Animals: </h1>
            <List animals={animals} />
          </div>
        );
      }

    We are using the String method startsWith (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/startsWith) to check if the animals starts with the letter L. This method either returns true or false.

    If the animals starts with the letter L, then we return the <li> element, which renders the particular animal. Otherwise, we return null to indicate that no element will be rendered.

  Using the && operator

    Another quick way of conditionally rendering an element is by using the && operator.

      function List(props) {
        return (
          <ul>
            {props.animals.map((animal) => {
              return animal.startsWith("L") && <li key={animal}>{animal}</li>;
            })}
          </ul>
        );
      }

      function App() {
        const animals = ["Lion", "Cow", "Snake", "Lizard"];

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Animals: </h1>
            <List animals={animals} />
          </div>
        );
      }

    We will leverage the return value of startsWith with the && operator. If the result of the startsWith function is true, then it returns the second operand, which is the <li> element, and renders it. Otherwise, if the condition is false it just gets ignored.

    # Numbers with Logical AND (&&) - a common pitfall

      When using && for conditional rendering, don't put numbers on the left side. The React docs on conditional rendering (https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering#logical-and-operator-) provide more details about this in the Pitfall box in the section about &&.

    Other ways to render conditionally

      We can also use if, if/else, and switch to conditionally render something.

      This time we will have two conditions:

        1. Check if the animals property is provided

        2. Check if the animals length is greater then 0

      We will frequently be dealing with lists in the future, and we also need to consider what to render if the list is empty or does not exist at all. You certainly would not want to see a blank page, would you? Let us try to implement that:

        function List(props) {
          if (!props.animals) {
            return <div>Loading...</div>;
          }

          if (props.animals.length === 0) {
            return <div>There are no animals in the list!</div>;
          }

          return (
            <ul>
              {props.animals.map((animal) => {
                return <li key={animal}>{animal}</li>;
              })}
            </ul>
          );
        }

        function App() {
          const animals = [];

          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Animals: </h1>
              <List animals={animals} />
            </div>
          );
        }

      In our <List /> component, we have two if statements acting as a guard that immediately returns an element based on the condition.

      One is to check if the property animal exists, and the other is to check if the length of the list is greater than 0. In this case, our list is empty, so the second if statement executes, which immediately returns the <div> element that contains the text "There are no animals in the list".

      If we remove the animals property:

        function App() {
          const animals = [];

          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Animals: </h1>
              <List />
            </div>
          );
        }

      The first if statement will now execute and return a <div> with the text "Loading...". This is often the case when you are fetching from an API, since it might take some time to actually retrieve the data, it is good practice to show an indicator of that.

      If none of those checks passed, then we have the data we need to render the list successfully. Try it out by adding items to the animals list and adding the property back.

      You can, of course, also accomplish this with just the ternary and && operators.

        function List(props) {
          return (
            <>
              {!props.animals ? (
                <div>Loading...</div>
              ) : props.animals.length > 0 ? (
                <ul>
                  {props.animals.map((animal) => {
                    return <li key={animal}>{animal}</li>;
                  })}
                </ul>
              ) : (
                <div>There are no animals in the list!</div>
              )}
            </>
          );
        }

        // or
        function List(props) {
          return (
            <>
              {!props.animals && <div>Loading...</div>}
              {props.animals && props.animals.length > 0 && (
                <ul>
                  {props.animals.map((animal) => {
                    return <li key={animal}>{animal}</li>;
                  })}
                </ul>
              )}
              {props.animals && props.animals.length === 0 && <div>There are no animals in the list!</div>}
            </>
          );
        }

        function App() {
          const animals = [];

          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Animals: </h1>
              <List animals={animals} />
            </div>
          );
        } 

      Nested ternaries and multiple && operators can be intimidating to look at, so be sure to test things out!
