Many paths

  There are multiple ways to start using React in your projects, from attaching a set of <script> tags which serve React from a CDN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), to robust toolchains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain) and frameworks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework) that are highly configurable and allow for increased scalability and optimization.

  Some examples of these toolchains include:

    - Vite's React Config (https://vitejs.dev/)
    - Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
    - NextJS (https://nextjs.org/)
    - Create React App (https://create-react-app.dev/) (Deprecated)

  Why do we need these toolchains? Can't we just make our own as we see fit?

  Yes, but it's hard. React is a complex beast and there are many moving parts. Before you can start writing any sort of code that provides functionality, you would need to configure at least the following:

    - Package Management (NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/), Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/))
    - Module bundling (Webpack (https://webpack.js.org/), Parcel (https://parceljs.org/))
    - Compilation (Babel (https://babeljs.io/))
    - React itself

  All of this, and sometimes much more, is required to get a React project and development environment up and running.

  # A note on Create React App

    Create React App, or CRA, was the official way to scaffold new React projects since its introduction in 2016. Unfortunately, owing to many reasons, CRA was deprecated in early 2023 (https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741). Due to CRA’s popularity, you’ll see it mentioned in many tutorials and guides. However, it’s no longer recommended to use it for new projects.

Simplifying the process

  Now that you understand what is involved with starting a React project from scratch, you can breathe a sigh of relief to learn that we can get started with a single terminal command.

  Vite builds frontend tools for developers and it leverages the latest technologies under the hood to provide a great developer experience. Fortunately, it also caters to the React ecosystem. We will use Vite’s CLI to quickly create a template React project. It requires minimal configuration and provides extremely useful tools right out of the box, allowing us to get straight to the learning. Let’s get started!

Creating a React app

  Please make sure that you are using the latest LTS version of Node, otherwise errors may occur. Open up the terminal and the folder containing your projects. Then enter the following command (you can replace my-first-react-app with any name you want):

    npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react

  You may be asked if you want to install the create-vite package, in which case you should accept by typing y then hitting Enter. Next, you will be asked if you want to Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)? and to Install with npm and start now?. You can confirm the default choice for both options, by pressing Enter for each of those questions.

  Once the command has executed, it should output the following:

    ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    ➜  Network: use --host to expose
    ➜  press h + enter to show help

  Provided everything has gone according to plan, head over to localhost:5173, where you’ll be greeted with the following page:

  (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/73199c4e9e43e8d87f8759e026c13b63fcfe73c7/react/introduction/setting_up_a_react_environment/imgs/vite_react_homepage.png)

  Congratulations! You've created your first React app. You can now exit out of the dev server (Ctrl + c) and cd into your project directory.

  To link your local project directory to a GitHub repo, create a new empty repo on GitHub then follow the instructions in the new repo's page to connect it to your local project directory.

  # Using an existing repo

    Alternatively, if you created a GitHub repo already and cloned it, you can cd into your cloned repo then run the above Vite command, using . as the project name:

      npm create vite@latest . -- --template react

    This will tell Vite to use the current directory for the project, instead of creating a new directory with the given project name. This cloned directory will already be initialized as a git repo and connected to the right remote.

Delving deeper

  Let’s take a closer look at our new project. Inside, you will find some folders, as well as package.json, package-lock.json, .gitignore, and README.md files. The README.md contains some useful information that you should take the time to skim through now.

  The public folder is where all of the static assets related to your app will go. This could include images, icons, and information files for the browser.

  Inside the src folder is where you will find the code that runs your app. The main.jsx file here serves as the entry point of the application. Let’s open the main.jsx file and see if we can understand what’s going on:

    import { StrictMode } from "react";
    import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
    import App from "./App.jsx";
    import "./index.css";

    createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
      <StrictMode>
        <App />
      </StrictMode>,
    );

  Whoa! There’s quite a lot here. You are not expected to recognize much of this (if any) right now. Here’s a brief rundown of what is happening:

  
    1. We import StrictMode and createRoot from the react and react-dom packages respectively.

    2. We import the App component from App.jsx, so that we may place (render) it within the DOM.

    3. We import some CSS styling (you may recognize this syntax from the Webpack material).

    4. We create a root object by invoking createRoot with an element from our index.html.

    5. We invoke the render method, which is attached to our root object, with some very interesting-looking syntax inside the parentheses.

Developer tools

  As you progress with React, your projects will undoubtedly become larger and larger and include more and more components, with increasing levels of functionality.

  When this happens, it’s useful to be able to track (and make live changes to) the moving parts inside of your app for understanding and debugging your code. To this end, we can use a Chrome extension called React Developer Tools.

  We recommend installing this and becoming comfortable using it as early as possible as it’s an invaluable tool for effective React development.
