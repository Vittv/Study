Animations vs transitions

  Animations let you animate elements from one style configuration to another. Does this sound familiar? You wouldn’t be wrong for thinking, “Well, what’s the point in learning animations if they are basically the same as transitions?”, but animations greatly expand on some capabilities that transitions do not have. A few of the differences include:

    - Transitions were designed to animate an element from one state to another. They can loop, but they weren't designed for that. Animations, on the other hand, were designed with the purpose of explicitly enabling loops.

    - Transitions need a trigger, such as the use of pseudo-classes like :hover or :focus, or by adding/removing a class via JavaScript. Animations, on the other hand, do not need such a trigger. Once you have your elements in place and CSS defined, an animation will start running immediately if that’s what you told it to do.

    - Transitions are not as flexible as using animations. When you define a transition, imagine you are sending that element on a journey in a straight line from point A to point B. Yes, the transition-timing-function can add some variation to the timing of this change, but it doesn’t compare to the amount of flexibility added by using animations.

  All in all, both animations and transitions have their use, so in addition to considering the above differences you should also use your best judgment. For example, if you need to change the opacity of an element when it is active then an animation would be overkill, but if you need to carry out something more complicated, animations will provide you with the tools you need.
 
Animation properties

  Let's see an animation in action to see what we've been talking about.

    .container {
      height: 100vh;
      width: 100vw;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

    #ball {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: red;
      border: 1px solid black;
      border-radius: 50%;
      animation-duration: 2s;
      animation-name: change-color;
      animation-iteration-count: infinite;
      animation-direction: alternate;
    }

    @keyframes change-color {
      from {
        background-color: red;
      }

      to {
        background-color: green;
      }
    }

  Note how the animation is already running and how it keeps repeating itself. We'll cover @keyframes rule at the bottom of our example in a bit, so for now focus on the actual animation properties used in the example above:

    - An animation-duration of two seconds. This means that it will take two seconds for the #ball element to complete one animation cycle.

    - Defined the animation-name to be “change-color” which is essential for the @keyframes section coming up next. This is just a custom name that is not a particular CSS value. We could have called it “pineapples” if we so wished, but for our purposes “change-color” suits us well.

    - Set the animation-iteration-count to infinite, which means this animation will run forever. You could set this to 1, 2, or as many iterations as you wish.

    - Set the animation-direction to alternate. This property decides if our animation should alternate direction on the completion of one cycle, or reset to the start point and repeat itself. Here it means that the #ball will smoothly change back to its original color instead of “jumping” straight back to red.

Keyframes

  Now it's time to tackle the second half of our animation definition by exploring the @keyframes at-rule.

    @keyframes change-color {
      from {
        background-color: red;
      }

      to {
        background-color: green;
      }
    }

  The @keyframes at-rule references the ‘change-color’ name we defined earlier. Then, we use the from and to properties to change the background-color of #ball from red to green.

  It’s important to know that keyframes use a percentage to indicate the times for an animation to take place and that the from and to statements are actually aliases for 0% and 100%, respectively. You can read from/0% as meaning ‘at zero seconds’ and to/100% as ‘at 2 seconds’ according to our animation-duration in our example from above. There is no hard and fast rule on whether or not you should use from/to or 0%/100%. Just pick a style and be consistent with it.

  The @keyframes at-rule also defines one animation cycle. So if we were to change our animation-iteration-count from earlier to 2 then the ball would change its background-color from red to green, then from green to red, and then the animation would stop. Be careful not to think of one iteration as a complete loop, but rather a single cycle from beginning to end (or end to beginning when alternating the direction).

  Now it’s time to introduce the shorthand notation for our animation properties and glimpse a little into the added flexibility of the keyframe notation. Check out the live example below then have a look at the notation.

    .container {
      height: 100vh;
      width: 100vw;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

    #ball {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      border: 1px solid black;
      border-radius: 50%;
      background-color: red;
      animation: 2s change-color infinite alternate;
    }

    @keyframes change-color {
      from {
        background-color: red;
      }
  
      50% {
        transform: scale(2);
        background-color: blue;
      }

      to {
        background-color: green;
      }
    }

  Here we added another keyframe for when the animation-duration is at 50%, or 1 second. This means as well as the background-color changing to an additional value, we have also specified that the ball doubles in size. Just be aware that additional keyframes are always defined in percentages. Only the 0%/100% values may use the from/to alias.

  Hopefully, this gives you a glimpse into the power the @keyframes syntax provides to you when it comes to controlling the animation of an element’s properties. You can add keyframes whenever you want, control whatever CSS-animatable properties you want, and have the control to add some real creative flair to your website elements.
