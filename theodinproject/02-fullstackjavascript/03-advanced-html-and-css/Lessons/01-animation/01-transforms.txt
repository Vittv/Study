The transform property is a powerful tool to change the appearance of elements without affecting the netural document flow.

Basics of transforms

  The transform property takes in one or more CSS transform functions as its values, with those functions taking in their own value, usually an angle or a number.

  Almost all elements can have the transform property applied to them, with the exceptions being <col>, <colgroup>, and non-replaced inline elements. "Non-replaced" refers to elements whose content is contained withint the HTML document (<span>, <b>, and <em>, for example), as opposed to a "replaced" element's content being contained outside of the document, the element itself being "replaced" by the external content (<video>, <iframe> and <img> for example). You do not need to memorize every element that is non-replaced, but rather keep this knowledge in mind should you try to apply the transform property to an element and aren't sure why it isn't working.

Two-dimensional transforms

  In this section, we'll go through 2D transforms with the following transform functions: rotate, scale, skew, and translate.

  Rotate

    This is the transform function value to rotate an element on a 2D plane:

      .element {
        transform: rotate();
      }

  Scale

    These are the transform function values to scale and element on a 2D plane:

      .element {
        transform: scaleX();
        transform: scaleY();
        transform: scale();
      }

  Skew

    These are the transform function values to skew an elementon a 2D plane:

      .element {
        transform: skewX();
        transform: skewY();
        transform: skew();
      }

  Translate

    These are the transform function values to translate an element on a 2D plane:

      .element {
        transform: translateX();
        transform: translateY();
        transform: translate();
      }

  Chaining multiple transforms

    Now that you have a grasp of 2D transforms, we will learn how to chain them. Chaining multiple transforms is done by adding more transform functions with a space between each one. Take a look at the code below:

      <div class="red-box"></div>
      <div class="blue-box"></div>

      .red-box,
      .blue-box {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
      }

      .red-box {
        background: red;
        transform: rotate(45deg) translate(200%);
      }

      .blue-box {
        background: blue;
        transform: translate(200%) rotate(45deg);
      }

    The blue box rotates 45 degrees on the spot, then translates on the X axis by 200%, moving it directly to the right. The red box translates by 200% first, so moves to the right, but the transform origin is still where it used to be. Therefore, it rotates 45 degrees around that original point, making the red box “swing down” to end up diagonally from where it started. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform#values

    While you can generally chain multiple transforms in any order for various results, there is one exception: perspective. This brings us nicely to the next section where perspective is involved.

Three-dimensional transforms

  The rotate, scale, and translate transform functions aren’t limited to just 2D planes. They also work for 3D planes as well! However, to perceive a 3D effect on some of these function values, perspective is required.

  From here on, the examples get more complicated. Feel free to play around with these properties, but be careful not to get too sidetracked with them.

  Perspective

    This is the transform function value to set the distance from the user to the z = 0 plane:

      .element {
        transform: perspective();
      }

    Essentially, by setting a perspective value, we are telling the object to render as if we were viewing it from a specific distance on the z-axis.

    Unlike other transform function values, perspective must be declared first (leftmost) when there are multiple transform function values. In the upcoming examples for rotate, scale, and translate, we will be able to see how it affects the target element.

  Rotate specific axis

    These are the additional transform function values to rotate an element in a 3D space:

    .element {
      transform: rotateX();
      transform: rotateY();
      transform: rotateZ();
      transform: rotate3d();
    }

  Scale specific axis

    These are the additional transform function values to scale an element in a 3D space:

      .element {
        transform: scaleZ();
        transform: scale3d();
      }

    See MDN's 3D cube in action with scaleZ and scale3d.

  Translate specific axis

    These are the additional transform function values to translate an element in a 3D space:

      .element {
        transform: translateZ();
        transform: translate3d();
      }

    translateZ doesn’t do much without perspective.

  Matrix

    While not strictly a 3D transform function, matrix is mentioned last in this lesson due to how uncommonly used it is. These are the transform function values for it.

      .element {
        transform: matrix();
        transform: matrix3d();
      }

    Matrix is a way of combining all transform functions into one. It is seldom used due to its poor readability, and almost never written by hand. Unless you have a very complex transformation to apply, you should use other transform function values instead.

    It is enough for you to know that these functions exist and generally how they work. However, it is not important for you to feel comfortable building with them.

Benefits of transforms

  In order to understand why the transform property is great, you have to be aware of CSS triggers. You can learn about it in The Pixel Pipeline (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/#the_pixel_pipeline) section from Google’s Web Fundamentals.

  The key benefit of using transform is that it occurs during composition. This makes it cheaper to use compared to many other CSS properties. You can see what triggers are executed with each CSS property in this table of CSS triggers (https://web.archive.org/web/20220727225220/https://csstriggers.com/).

  Another benefit of transform is that it can be hardware-accelerated via a device’s GPU (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (you don’t have to understand how a GPU works but it is good to be aware of the term and what it means). This benefit is more prominent when it comes to transitions and animations which you will learn about in the following lessons.
