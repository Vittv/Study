What is web accessibility?

  Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible.

  There are different types of disabilities, including (but not limited to) auditory, physical/motor, cognitive, or visual. A disability can be permanent, such as a user who is completely blind or deaf, or it can be temporary, such as a user with a broken arm. Users can have multiple disabilities at any given time.Older users with changing abilities may even have similar conditions as those who have a disability.

  Situational limitations are a little different. Using a phone outside on a bright day, browsing a site with one hand while you're busy doing something else with the other, or living in an area where the internet is slow or the bandwidth is expensive are all examples of situational limitations. These limitations, unlike a disability, occur to users only in specific situations, but are still important to keep in mind when developing a website.

Why web accessibility matters

  Let's first look at a non-web example to gain a little perspective.Imagine being in a multi-storied building that has no elevator. For some people, this might only be an annoyance. "Huh, no elevator. I guess I'll walk up a few flights of stairs, then."
  A person that requires a wheelchair, however, would find it impossible, or at the very least much more difficult, to go anywhere beyond the first floor. Even if a person in a wheelchair had someone to life the wheelchair up each step, it would be a much more difficult process. The point here is that an elevator would have made this building more accessible.

  The building is your website, and the elevator is a collection of various accessibility features and tool (...it's a pretty big elevator). When you develop a website, you're developing it for users, and you need that website to actually be *usable* by them. People with disabilities, older people with changing abilities, people who aren't as tech savvy, and people with some sort of situational limitation are still users, and websites should be as equally usable by them as possible.

  One other pretty big reason that accessibility matters is that, depending on the country, there could actually be laws *requiring* accessibility to be implemented.
