Now that you are equipped with the necessary knowledge to make your websites more accessible to many users, the question arises: How can we verify the correct implementation of a11y features? Are there any mistakes to be corrected or potential improvements to be made? In this lesson, we will answer those questions to help push your a11y skills over the top.

Accessibility auditing

  There are plenty of third-party tools to audit the accessibility of a web page, each with its own pros and cons. Here, we’re only going to mention three of those tools. By getting into the habit of auditing your web pages, you’ll be able to track down any outstanding a11y issues that you may have missed. Whether you decide to utilize one of these tools or any other auditing tool you prefer, you should only focus on fixing issues related to the concepts introduced in this portion of the curriculum for now.

    - axe DevTools for Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US) is an extension-based tool that returns a list of issues ranked by severity level, and will note any issues for you to manually check.

    - Lighthouse for Chrome (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) is available in the Chrome DevTools by default (it might also be listed as the Auditing tab) or it can be run from the command line. Lighthouse provides more than just a11y auditing, including performance, best practices, search engine optimization (SEO), and progressive web app (PWA) if applicable. Issues are separated by category, and like the axe DevTools, there may be a list of issues for you to manually check.

    WebAIM’s WAVE (https://wave.webaim.org/) is a website-based tool where you enter the URL of the page you want to audit. There are also browser extensions and API options. WAVE will return a preview of the page with an overlay of icons on it, and issues are separated into categories of alerts, warnings, and contrast errors. Unfortunately, the icons that are placed on the page may cause the layout to break, but that could be a minor issue if you’re more focused on the a11y issues that are found.

  Of course, one of the best ways to check the accessibility of your websites is to get feedback from users who rely on these accessibility features. This isn't always an easy option, but it's worth hearing from those who may be affected by your site's accessibility (or lack of it).
