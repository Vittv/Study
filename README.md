# Study Documentation

Welcome to my study repository! Here, I document my learning journey through various courses, lessons, and projects in the field of programming and web development.
>All courses below offer certification (aside from TOP)

## Finished Courses

### 1. [Python3](https://github.com/Vittv/Study/tree/main/cursoemvideo/Python)
- **ETC:** 120 hours
- **Language:** Portuguese (PT)
- **Platform:** cursoemvideo
- **Description:** This course taught me all the way from print('Hello World') to functions, modules, packages. But it did not cover classes or anything more. It was a total of 23 lessons and 115 exercises. You'd watch the lesson and be given around 5-10 exercises to finish before the next lesson. To finish the whole course, you had to not only do every exercise but watch their explanation after each lesson. So you always knew how to build what was asked for in the end, even if you had no idea at first.

### 2. [Responsive Web Design](https://github.com/Vittv/Study/tree/main/freecodecamp/01%20-%20Responsive%20Web%20Design)
- **ETC:** 50 hours
- **Language:** English (EN)
- **Platform:** freeCodeCamp
- **Description:** This one taught me HTML and CSS. It had quite a different approach compared to my Python course. Because this time, it was entirely project based. Every lesson was a project you built along instructions. You do a few project lessons, building small projects as you go, and then a final project for that module. It was a total of 15 lessons and 5 final projects. Finish 5 final projects and get your certification. I will say, this course was fun, it made developing feel more real. As I could see what I was doing and how everything worked. In the end it left me with some nice projects. Nothing to be super proud of, but they look nice, making the experience very satisfying in the end.

### 3. [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/Vittv/Study/tree/main/freecodecamp/02%20-%20JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures)
- **ETC:** 80 hours
- **Language:** English (EN)
- **Platform:** freeCodeCamp
- **Description:** After learning all the HTML and CSS basics, the curriculum gets you ready to add interaction to your now styled web page. Some of the topics were Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API. This course was definitely not easy compared to the previous ones. I felt stuck a few times and had a hard time with some of the Lessons and Projects. Although it was a bit difficult, it felt even more satisfying than the Web Design course. Because now, with JavaScript, we're able to perform more complex tasks, so the web page starts feeling a little more useful and there are almost no limits to what you can do with such tools.

### 4. [Front End Development Libraries](https://github.com/Vittv/Study/tree/main/freecodecamp/03%20-%20Front%20End%20Development%20Libraries)
- **ETC:** 60 hours
- **Language:** English (EN)
- **Platform:** freeCodeCamp
- **Description:** Currently working on project 3/5. This time around, I've decided to combine every project into one single preview webpage that is able to redirect you to each individual project. Since this is a little more complex than usual and also involves libraries and frameworks I've never worked with before, it will take some time.

- **Status:**
1. Build a Random Quote Machine (jQuery, Bootstrap) ✅
2. Build a Markdown Previewer (React) ✅
3. Build a Drum Machine (React) ✅
4. Build a JavaScript Calculator (React, Sass) - finishing styling ⌛
5. Build a 25 + 5 Clock (Working on it) ⌛

## Future Plans

Once I have completed the above courses, I plan to either:

- Enroll in [The Odin Project's Web Development Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths), which offers a comprehensive path to becoming a Full Stack Developer.
- Continue with additional courses on freecodecamp to further expand my skills before pursuing The Odin Project.
